#A simple two input multiplexer

This directory contains the following files:      
 * module.py - the logical description     
 * simulation.py - the simulation and VHDL code generation
 * test_mux.vcd - the simulation result     
 * Mux.vhd - the generated VHDL code     
Note: to keep the repository clean, I have removed some files!    
To rerun the simulation, run **python simulation.py**
